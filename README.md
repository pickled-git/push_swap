**Project goal:** Design and implement a program in C to sort a stack of integers using a limited set of operations in the most efficient way possible.

### Mandatory

The objective of this project is to create a program named **`push_swap`**, which will sort numbers into stack **`a`** using the least possible number of operations. This will be done with two stacks (**`a`** and **`b`**) and a set of instructions to manipulate both stacks. The project emphasizes the implementation and optimization of sorting algorithms and understanding the algorithmic complexity in C programming.

| Program name | push_swap |
|:--- |:---|
| Turn in files | Makefile, *.h, *.c |
| Makefile  | NAME, all, clean, fclean, re |
| Arguments | stack a: A list of integers |
| External functs. | - read, write, malloc, free, exit<br>- ft_printf and any equivalent  YOU coded |
| Libft authorized | Yes |
| Description  | Sort stacks  |


### Bonus

- Improve the efficiency of the sorting algorithm to handle larger sets of numbers with fewer operations.
- Develop a checker program that will verify the sequence of operations applied to sort the stack effectively.
